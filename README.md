## Features
- Single-entrypoint script (`blockdag.sh`) that loads your mining address and launches Docker Compose.
- Cross-platform Docker Compose detection (`node.sh`) compatible with Compose v1 and v2 syntaxes.
- Opinionated directory structure for persisted blockchain data, logs, and binaries under `bin/bdag/`.
- Sample environment file (`.env`) for storing wallet configuration.
- Optional Linux helper to install Docker & Docker Compose (`install_docker.sh`).

## Repository Layout
```
blockdag.sh             # Primary launcher – loads wallet and calls node.sh
node.sh                 # Starts docker compose with the provided mining address
restart.sh              # Stops current stack, removes image, restarts with existing data
restartWithCleanup.sh   # Same as above, but wipes ./bin/bdag before restart
stop.sh                 # Stops running containers for a specific role or all roles
install_docker.sh       # Ubuntu-based helper to install Docker & docker-compose
docker-compose.yml      # Defines the BlockDAG worker service and persisted volumes
bin/bdag/data           # Blockchain data volume (created at runtime)
bin/bdag/logs           # Node log output (created at runtime)
.env                    # Optional environment file (example provided)
wallet.txt              # Optional file containing wallet info, last line read as mining address
```

> **Note:** `bin/bdag/data` and `bin/bdag/logs` may be empty until the node runs. If they contain testnet data generated by previous runs, they might require elevated permissions to inspect or delete.

## Requirements

### Operating Systems
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.)**: fully supported. Scripts assume a POSIX shell and Docker.
- **macOS (Ventura 13+ recommended)**: supported as long as Docker Desktop is installed.
- **Windows**: run inside [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) or another Linux-like environment. Native PowerShell is not supported by these scripts.

### Software
- Docker Engine & Docker Compose v1 or v2.
- Git (to clone the repository).
- `bash` (all scripts use Bash features).

Optional for Linux users:
- `curl`, `apt`, etc. – `install_docker.sh` targets Ubuntu 20.04+ and requires root.

### Hardware Guidelines
- **CPU**: Minimum 4 cores (4+ cores recommended for mining).
- **Memory (RAM)**: At least 8GB (8GB+ recommended).
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 20GB of free disk space. More storage is recommended depending on the size of the blockchain and logs.
- **Network**: A stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth.

### Wallet Format Notice
- BlockDAG nodes now use **EVM-compatible public addresses (0x…)** for mining rewards.
- Legacy **UTXO-based PK addresses are no longer supported**. Update any automation, scripts, or stored credentials to point to an EVM wallet before starting the node.

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlockdagNetworkLabs/blockdag-scripts.git
   cd blockdag-scripts
   ```

2. **Configure your mining address**
   - Option A: edit `.env` and set `PUB_ETH_ADDR=<your_evm_wallet_address>`.
   - Option B: create `wallet.txt` where the last line contains your wallet address (e.g. exported from another tool).

   If both exist, `.env` takes precedence.

   > **Network note:** These scripts target the latest EVM-based BlockDAG network only. Do not reuse legacy UTXO addresses; configure a 0x-prefixed EVM wallet for mining rewards.

3. **Verify Docker access**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker compose version  # or docker-compose --version
   ```
   If Docker is not installed on Ubuntu, you can adapt the provided `install_docker.sh` script (requires `sudo`).

4. **Allow Docker to create local directories**
   Ensure your user has permissions to write to `bin/bdag/`. The directory is created automatically, but on Linux you may need to `chown` it if Docker runs as root.

2. **Configure your mining address**
   - Option A: edit `.env` and set `PUB_ETH_ADDR=<your_evm_wallet_address>`.
   - Option B: create `wallet.txt` where the last line contains your wallet address (e.g. exported from another tool).

## Address Format Update (EVM Only)

- BlockDAG mining rewards are now paid to Ethereum-style accounts. Supply an `0x`-prefixed EVM public address wherever the scripts expect `PUB_ETH_ADDR`.
- If you are migrating from earlier releases that referenced UTXO/PK addresses, regenerate or import an EVM wallet and update `.env` or `wallet.txt` accordingly.
- Remove any legacy environment variables or files that still contain the deprecated address format to avoid accidental misconfiguration.

---

## Running the Node

1. Launch the node (prompts will depend on your shell configuration): Choose a role or omit it to default to the miner archive template:
   ```bash
   ./blockdag.sh               # default miner node
   ./blockdag.sh full          # validation without mining
   ./blockdag.sh relay         # gateway relay mode
   ```
   The script resolves your address, exports it as `PUB_ETH_ADDR`, selects the matching compose file, and calls node.sh`. Set `NODE_ROLE=<role>` in your
   environment if you prefer not to pass a CLI argument.

2. `node.sh` selects the correct Docker Compose syntax for your installation and starts the stack with `MINING_ADDRESS` set from your EVM wallet.

3. Once the containers are up:
   ```bash
   docker ps            # Verify the blockdag-testnet-network container is running
   tail -f bin/bdag/logs/node.log  # Replace with actual filename after first run
   ```

To stop the node without cleaning data:
```bash
docker compose down    # or docker-compose down
```

## Node Types & Compose Configurations

This repository now ships dedicated Docker Compose files for each supported node role. All templates default to **EVM archive mode** so historical chain state is preserved out of the box. If you prefer a pruned node, remove `--gcmode=archive` from the corresponding `NODE_ARGS` before launching.

| Node type | Compose file | Highlights |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Miner | `docker-compose.yml` | Enables mining via `--miner`/`--generate` and exposes JSON-RPC/WebSocket endpoints for local tooling. |
| Full | `docker-compose.full.yml` | Syncs and validates the network without mining. |
| Relay | `docker-compose.relay.yml` | Runs the gateway stack (`--gateway`) to proxy DAG/EVM traffic for external clients. |

> **Tip:** Any of the non-archive templates can double as an archive node just
> by keeping the default `--gcmode=archive`. Removing that flag reverts to the
> previous pruned behaviour.

To start a specific role with the helper script, run `./blockdag.sh <role>`. For
example, `./blockdag.sh relay` loads `docker-compose.relay.yml` while
`./blockdag.sh full` launches the `docker-compose.full.yml`. Use
`./blockdag.sh` to fall back to the default `docker-compose.yml` miner node.

### Launching a specific node type

1. Copy the compose file that matches your desired role or reference it
   directly when starting Docker Compose. For example, to run a miner node in
   archive mode:

   ```bash
   MINING_ADDRESS=$PUB_ETH_ADDR docker compose -f docker-compose.miner.yml up -d
   ```

2. Follow the same pattern for the other node types by substituting the compose
   file.

3. When archive storage is not required, edit the chosen compose file and
   remove `--gcmode=archive` from the embedded `--evmenv` string before
   launching.

Refer to the [Additional Note](#additional-note-applies-to-all-node-types) below
for more context on the archive flag and recommended hardware for long-term
archive deployments.

## Maintenance Tasks

Use the helper scripts at the repository root:

- `stop.sh [role|all]` – stops containers for the selected role (defaults to `miner`). Pass `all` to shut down miner, full, and relay stacks in one go.
- `restart.sh [role]` – shuts down Docker Compose for the selected role (defaults to `miner`), removes the image referenced by the compose file, and relaunches using your configured wallet.
- `restartWithCleanup.sh [role]` – same as above but also clears `./bin/bdag/*` (data, logs, any cached binaries). **Back up your wallet before running this.**
- `install_docker.sh` – Ubuntu/WSL convenience installer. Review the script before executing (`sudo ./install_docker.sh`).

Manual alternatives:
```bash
# Pull the latest image
MINING_ADDRESS=$PUB_ETH_ADDR docker compose pull

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Remove volumes and containers
docker compose down --volumes
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"PUB_ETH_ADDR not set"**: Confirm `.env` or `wallet.txt` exists and the address is on the last line. Reload your shell if you edited `.env` while a session was running.
- **Docker permission denied**: Add your user to the `docker` group (`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`) and restart your session, or run the scripts with `sudo`.
- **Node restarts on launch**: Inspect `bin/bdag/logs` for recent log files. If corruption errors appear, run `./restartWithCleanup.sh` to wipe local state.
- **Port conflicts**: Default ports 38131, 18545, 18546, and 18150 must be free. Stop other services using them or edit `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Windows path issues**: Ensure the repository lives inside your WSL filesystem (e.g. `/home/<user>`), not the mounted `C:` drive, to avoid Docker volume permission problems.

---

## Data & Security Notes
- The wallet address (`PUB_ETH_ADDR`) is injected into the container as `MINING_ADDRESS`. It must be an EVM address; do not reuse retired UTXO-style identifiers.
- Do not commit `.env` or `wallet.txt` with real keys.
- Blockchain data persists in `bin/bdag/data/`. Back it up before destructive operations.
- Logs populate `bin/bdag/logs/` and may contain sensitive operational details; sanitize before sharing.
- Consider rotating Docker logs or mounting external storage if running long-term.

`docker-compose.yml` launches a single service named `nodeworker` based on `abhishek1857/blockdag:worker-20250923-102625`. Key settings:

## Reference: Docker Compose Service

`docker-compose.yml` launches a single service named `nodeworker` based on `blockdagnetwork/awakening:v0.0.3`. Key settings:

- **Ports**: `38131` (RPC), `18545` (HTTP), `18546` (WebSocket), `18150` (peer).
- **Volumes**:
  - `bdag_bin` named volume mounted at `/opt/bdag` inside the container.
  - Local `./bin/bdag/data` → `/bdag/data` for chain data.
  - Local `./bin/bdag/logs` → `/bdag/logs` for logs.
- **Environment**: `NODE_ARGS` assembles testnet flags, mining options, CORS/websocket settings, and seeds a peer.

Customize the image tag or arguments directly in `docker-compose.yml` if the network releases new versions.
